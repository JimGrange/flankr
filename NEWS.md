# flankr v1.2.0 
* 50% further efficiency in DSTP simulation speed
* 24% further efficiency in SSP simulation speed
* Note that the way random seeds are handled in both $\textt{simulateDSTP}$ and
$\textt{simulateSSP}$ is slightly different to that in version 1.0.0 (initial 
release). Therefore, there may be very slight differences between simulation 
data (and therefore potentially very slight differences in best-fitting 
parameter values) between versions.

# flankr v1.1.0
* More efficient simulation---and therefore fitting---of both the DSTP and 
SSP models. (But more to be done on this!)
* Refactored some code & examples in preparation for CRAN submission. 
(But more to be done on this!)
* Added function name aliases to allow for snake_case.

# flankr v1.0.0
* Initial release (Github only)
