\title{Fit the DSTP model to human data}
\usage{
fitDSTP(
  data,
  conditionName = NULL,
  parms = c(0.145, 0.08, 0.1, 0.07, 0.325, 1.3, 0.24),
  cdfs = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9),
  cafs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing human data. See \code{?exampleData} for
data formatted correctly.}

\item{conditionName}{If there is an additional experimental manipulation
(i.e., other than target congruency) the model can only be fit to one at a
time. Tell the function which condition is currently being fit by passing
a string to the function (e.g., "present"). The function by default assumes
no additional condition (e.g., conditionName is set to NULL).}

\item{parms}{A vector of starting parameters to use in the minimisation
routine. Must be in the order: \code{A}, \code{C}, \code{driftTarget},
\code{driftFlanker}, \code{diftStimSelection}, \code{driftRS2}, \code{ter}.}

\item{cdfs}{A vector of quantile values for cumulative distribution functions
to be estimated from the human data. The model will attempt to find the
best-fitting parameters that match this distributional data.}

\item{cafs}{A vector of quantiles for conditional accuracy functions to be
estimated from the human data. The model will attempt to find the best-
fitting parameters that match this distributional data.}

\item{maxParms}{A vector containing upper limits on possible parameter
values.}

\item{nTrials}{An integer stating how many trials to simulate per iteration
of the fitting cycle for each congruency type.}

\item{multipleSubjects}{A boolean stating whether the fit is to multiple
subjects (multipleSubjects = TRUE) or to a single subject
(multipleSubjects = FALSE).}
}
\value{
\code{bestParameters} A vector of the best-fitting parameters found
by the current fit run.

\code{g2} The value of Wilks likelihood ratio (G2) obtained by the
current fit run.

\code{bBIC} The value of the  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
obtained by the current fit run. This is calculated using the BIC equation
for binned data, hence bBIC (binned BIC).
}
\description{
\code{fitDSTP} fits the DSTP model to a single experimental condition of
human data (besides congruency, which it accounts for simutaneously).
}
\details{
This function can be employed by the user to find the best-fitting
parameters of the DSTP model to fit the human data of a single experimental
condition. The fitting procedure accounts for congruent and incongruent
trials simultaneously. The fit is obtained by a gradient-descent method
(using the Nelder-Mead method contained in R's \code{optim} function) and is
fit to the proportion of data contained in human CDF and CAF distributional
data.

# Load the example data the comes with the \code{flankr} package
data(exampleData)

# Fit the model to the condition "present" in the example data set using
# the default settings in the model.

# Fit the model using new starting parameters.

newParms <- c(0.08, 0.11, 0.127, 0.020, 0.365, 1.140, 0.280)
fit <- fitDSTP(exampleData, conditionName = "present", parms = newParms)

# Fit the model using different CDF and CAF values, and 100,000 trials per
# fit cycle
cdfs <- c(.2, .4, .6, .8)
cafs <- c(.2, .4, .6, .8)

fit <- fitDSTP(exampleData, conditionName = "present", cdfs = cdfs,
