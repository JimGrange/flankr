# flankr v1.2.0

An R package implementing computational models of Eriksen flanker task
performance. Full details of how to use the package is available in the
following paper:

## Updates for version 1.2.0

- 50% further efficiency in DSTP simulation speed
- 24% further efficiency in SSP simulation speed
- Note that the way random seeds are handled in both
  $\texttt{simulateDSTP}$ and $\texttt{simulateSSP}$ is slightly
  different to that in version 1.0.0 (initial release). Therefore, there
  may be very slight differences between simulation data (and therefore
  potentially very slight differences in best-fitting parameter values)
  between versions.
