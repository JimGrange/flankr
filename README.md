## Updates for version 1.1.0

- More efficient simulation—and therefore fitting—of both the DSTP and
  SSP models. (But more to be done on this!)
- Refactored some code & examples in preparation for CRAN submission.
  (But more to be done on this!)
- Added function name aliases to allow for snake_case.
