Package: flankr
Title: Implements computational models of attentional selectivity
Version: 1.0.0.0
Authors@R: "Jim Grange <grange.jim@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: flankr provides functions to simulate and fit the dual stage two
    phase model (DSTP) and the shrinking spotlight model (SSP) of attentional
    selectivity. The fitting routine utilises the optim function in base R and
    finds model parameters that reduces the wilks likelihood ratio chi square
    between model predictions and human data (example data is provided in the
    package). BIC values based on response time bins are also provided to allow the
    user to engage in model comparison exploration.
