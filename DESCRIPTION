Description: Functions to simulate and fit the dual stage two phase (DSTP) and
    shrinking spotlight (SSP) models of attentional selectivity. Fitting uses
    base R's 'optim()' to minimise the Wilks likelihood-ratio chi-square between
    model predictions and human data (example data included). Binned BIC values
    are provided for model comparison.
