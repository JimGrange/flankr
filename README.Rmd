# flankr v1.2.0 <a><img src='images/logo.png' align="right" height="250"/></a>

$\texttt{flankr}$ is an R package implementing computational models of Eriksen flanker task performance. 

## Installation
The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("JimGrange/flankr")
```

## User guide
Full details of how to use the package is available in the following paper:

Grange, J.A. (2016). flankr: An R package for implementing computational models of attentional selectivity. *Behavior Research Methods, 48,* 528â€“541.

## Updates for version 1.2.0
* 50% further efficiency in DSTP simulation speed
* 24% further efficiency in SSP simulation speed
* Note that the way random seeds are handled in both $\texttt{simulateDSTP}$ and $\texttt{simulateSSP}$ is slightly different to that in version 1.0.0 (initial release). Therefore, there may be very slight differences between simulation data (and therefore potentially very slight differences in best-fitting parameter values) between versions.
